PATRICK gets to the car. He puts music on and seems celebrating a victory. In some point he’s laughing and say “Eric.Surname had sex with a man” but as the songs go, he slowly realized that something was wrong there.
Songs options: Streetlights 
by Raz Shmueli

Streetlights outside
A Violin is playing out of tune.
I'm leaving it all before
Darkness forever falls.

A Light, I'm starting to run
so that the air won't escape me.
After it's all be over,
only the fear always survives 

(Chorus):
No one can see my tears
I built labyrinths inside my eyes 
My smile hides it all
My smile hides it all

A new morning over a City
The silence whispers me a secret
From now on, it's only me and myself
I won't stumble anymore, I won't fall

(Chorus):
No one can see my tears
I built labyrinths inside my eyes 
My smile hides it all
My smile hides it all
