It's noon. The kids are eating at the dining room. Eric single PATRICK to go. Eric and PATRICK are in the backstage (motive). Eric push Patrick and crush him against the wall. Than he graves his head and force him to give him oral. PATRICK resist Eric for the first time. Then some classmates are getting in the hall, and Eric shouts “don’t touch me queer”.
