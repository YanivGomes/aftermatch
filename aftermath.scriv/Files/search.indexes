DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LOCAL CHURCH - DAY
It is Sunday service and the crowd is ending a pray song. We see the Hill family without John, some of his classmates (Marcus, Kevin. Not hope, Nicole) too. Pastor O'Grady makes the weekly speech.
PASTOR O'GRADY
There is an old epidemic washing this nation in the past years
Holding the book

For the angeles who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling - these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great day. In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorra and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion (Jude 1:6-7). 
The crowd nods

An old epidemic. When people behave like some people in San Francisco, the LORD sent us a gift called AIDS.  
The crowd sings "May the road rise up to meet you" </Text>

            <Text>SCREENPLAY FORMAT

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a formatted screenplay. By default it is set to export to Final Draft 8 format, but you can change this to print it or export it to a different format instead.

How To Use This Template
	•	Edit the Title Page document inside the “Front Matter” folder to ensure it contains the correct information.
	•	Create new documents inside the “Scenes” folder and use Scrivener’s script mode (Format &gt; Scriptwriting &gt; Script Mode - Screenplay) to write your script. It’s up to you whether you use a separate document for each scene or not.
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your screenplay. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do - you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way. Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
	•	Compile your script for printing or exporting by selecting File &gt; Compile.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
	•	Project and author name: The default book title and author name can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
	•	Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
	1.	To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
	2.	To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
	3.	To set things up so that when the special folder created in (1) is selected and you hit “Add”, a new document based on the one you set up in (2) is created, select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default New Subdocument Type and select the special template document you created.

Sample Document
See the “Sample Script” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a script that has been created using this template.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LOCAL BUDDY'S BAR - EVENING
Patrick gets to the bar and scan the place. Booths, corner bench. Enough light to see, but not more than that. The bar is partly crowded. Classical American Rock at the juke box. Patrick sit on the high chairs in the barman area. The bar-woman, Claris, is at her 30's. She speaks with two men around 50 years old.
CLARIS
I'll be right with you buddy
Patrick nods while Claris seems to end the conversation.
CLARIS
Hallo buddy, what are we having tonight?
PATRICK
Except hope and sympathy?
CLARIS
Except hope and sympathy.
PATRICK
I'll have Black Russian
CLARIS
Uh Black Russian, your'e not from around, aren't you?
Claris starts to make Black Russia
PATRICK
Is that so obvious?
CLARIS
Black Russia here is stranger than my sympathy.
PATRICK
I actually grown up in this town.
CLARIS
No kidding. Something must happened  to you on your way.
PATRICK
Two decades of liberty (laugh)
CLARIS
Are we that bad? 
PATRICK
I got out of the closet and didn't come back until now.
CLARIS

No one appreciate their liberty until they know oppression.
PATRICK
You got that right.
Claris serves the drink.
CLARIS
Welcome home buddy (smiles)
Patrick smiles back, raise his glass and drink.
Time pass by the bar is packed and it goes partly crowed again. Patrick sits by himself but hardly communicates with others. Locals come and go. A SHOT OF A CLOCK - it's midnight.
PATRICK
(To Claris) I'll have the bill now
CLARIS
(Pointing to Marcus that sits in a far booth) Someone else already did. 
Patrick get up and go towards Marcus sit.
PATRICK
Thanks for taking care of my bill.
MARCUS
That was nothing. It was my pleasure. Would you like to join me?
(Beat)
PATRICK
Yeah, I'll hear you out now.
Patrick sit infant Marcus. The bar is slowly getting empty and music had changed to slow.
MARCUS
How are these days? What are you doing?
PATRICK
I'm doing just fine. Living out of the closet, laude and proud. What about you? Are you married? kids?
MARCUS
Nope. It's just me. I never got married or had children.
(Beat)
MARCUS
Are you back for good?
PATRICK
Marcus, its after midnight, lets cut the crap. What do you want?
MARCUS
Man. I am sorry. I'm so sorry about all the staff I done to you. I want you to know that if there is anything I regret of all this years is how I treated you. If only I can turn back time, I wouldn't be an ass.
PATRICK
Well, you can't. What do you expect me to say? To do?
MARCUS
Understand my regrets. Understand that I'm truly sorry. Maybe even forgive me.
PATRICK
Just like that?
MARCUS
Maybe if I tell you about years of self-hate. I thought I was ugly. I feared of rejection. And how much I hated myself. Only now I know that I wished to be half good looking as you.
PATRICK
Are you gay Marcus?
MARCUS
No.
PATRICK
See, if you asking me to understand you today, how can I be sure you understand me today?
MARCUS
I do, believe me, I do. I got nothing against gays. Be what ever you are, you know. 
PATRICK
No no no, this is not about me being gay. This is about me getting rejected de facto. Its about waking up every morning to a nightmare. Going to the same school with the same people that being mean to you just because your'e weak. Its about your good friend, at the sensitive years of puberty, tag you as a pervert. And the worst part is that there is no where to go, no where to escape. Have you ever felt trapped? Real trapped?
(Beat)
MARCUS
No.
PATRICK
I didn't expect else. Don't speak with me about self hatred. If you need my forgiveness, as you clam you are, I need more than words.
MARCUS
Sure, anything you say man.
PATRICK
If you truly wants to understand what you done to me, how damaged I am so many years after, I want you to fuck me.
MARCUS
What?
PATRICK
You heard me. I - need - you - to - fuck - me.
MARCUS
(In shock) Eh...
Patrick is taking out a business card fro his wallet and put it on the table.

There is a new epidemic washing this nation. I say this is not a new epidemic, but old one. 

For the angeles who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling - these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great day. In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorra and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion (Jude 1:6-7). 

It is not a new epidemic, but an old one. When people behave like some people in San Francisco, the LORD sent us a gift called AIDS.

Patrick gets to the car. He puts radio on. He celebrate a victory.
The radio plays "Let me Kiss You" by Morrissey (This is a proposal. Director might change the song and Patrick's leap singing accordingly). Patrick increases the radio volume. 
PATRICK
(Leaps singing)
There's a place in the sun,/ for anyone who has the will to chase one/ and I think I've found mine,/ yes, I do believe I have found mine, so/ close your eyes,/ and think of someone,/ you physically admire/ and let me kiss you,/ let me kiss you. (Beat)
PATRICK
Anything new in your life Mr. Hill? Well, let's see...oh, Marcus Gibson just fucked me. But he fucked you most of your life in Smallvile. True, but this time it was different, Marcus Gibson just had sex with a man. Now who's fucking who?! (Laughs)
PATRICK
(Leaps singing)
Close your eyes,/ and think of someone,/ you physically admire/ and let me kiss you,/ let me kiss you.
The song goes on and Patrick slowly lose his smile and realize that something was wrong there. He's not feeling good nor victory no more.
VOICE
(Song over radio continues) But then you open your eyes,/ and you see someone,/ that you physically despise/ but my heart is open/ my heart is open to you.</Text>

Streetlights outside
A Violin is playing out of tune.
I'm leaving it all before
Darkness forever falls.

A Light, I'm starting to run
so that the air won't escape me.
After it's all be over,
only the fear always survives 

(Chorus):
No one can see my tears
I built labyrinths inside my eyes 
My smile hides it all
My smile hides it all

A new morning over a City
The silence whispers me a secret
From now on, it's only me and myself
I won't stumble anymore, I won't fall

(Chorus):
No one can see my tears
I built labyrinths inside my eyes 
My smile hides it all
My smile hides it all</Synopsis>

Josh...Its really you
Patrick get up and give long loving hug. Josh sits with Patrick.

After you left I was looking for you.
JOSH
(Smiles) I guess we aren't a generation of social media.
PATRICK
What's going on with you? So many years.
JOSH
(Smiles) Yeah so many years. I'm an architect.
PATRICK
Good good
JOSH
I have a charming hubby and two amazing kids. 
PATRICK
Well I'm not surprised at all. Tell them I think they are lucky.

At age 13 you've been my idol.

JOSH
I was in Smallvile few years ago.
PATRICK
Oh. I thought your parents left Smallvile.
JOSH
They did, but they left the house there and I needed to take care of the sale.
PATRICK
I see.
JOSH
I met Marcus
PATRICK
Oh. So many years. How he's doing?
JOSH
You should know how he's doing. You met him too.
PATRICK
Was it that year?
JOSH
He told me all about.
PATRICK
Like what
JOSH
Everything Patrick. The terms of forgiveness. He said you forgive him but all I could hear is your revenge.
PATRICK
I see. Thanks for letting me know.
JOSH
That's it? Is this your response?
PATRICK
Josh, I don't think you can judge me today. Or at all. He had it coming. 
JOSH
I was there for you. I encouraged you to be yourself. Instead, you learnt how to be Marcus.
PATRICK
Every day I remember those years, but you were NOT there for me.
JOSH
I had to go to collage at some point, but until then, I was there for you like no one else was.
PATRICK
YOU were not there for me, you were not there at all. YOU are nothing but a fictional character in a mind of a screenwriter.

PATRICK
(V.O.) The closet we forced to get into, it's built around us as social rejection increase. 
The closet is a cage for the soul, and it's blocking our sun light. When darkness falls, so does fear grows and spread all around.

But fear is temporary. For some of us it can take our childhood, or our youth, our best years, and years after. Until we get the fuck out of our nowhere hometown and discover that fear can't survive under the sun. 
It takes one courageous moment to tare the closet apart, but it won't happen without a beacon. Someone like you that already been there and done it. 
What makes us happy. How to except ourselves as who we are. What makes us unique. How we won't harm others as others harmed us. 
We need to know that we are not alone out there. That it is totally OK to be gay. 

Lot's of beacons makes a daylight, and it is something worth fighting for.

Your name Your address Your phone number Your e-mail address
FADE IN:
INT. A MESSY LIVING ROOM - DAY
KB sits at his laptop, pondering upon the nature of screenplay format. The INTERNET helps him.
KB How does this work then?
INTERNET We have an imaginary conversation
about script format. It's not very sophisticated or imaginative, but you have a hangover.
KB (embarrassed)
That's true. So is it easy to create a standard Hollywood- formatted screenplay in Scrivener, then?
INTERNET Fairly. This PDF file was in fact
created in Scrivener, using the basic Screenplay project template. The text was typing using Script Mode from the Format &gt; Scriptwriting menu, and then the whole thing was turned into a PDF file using Compile (File &gt; Compile...).
KB Handy. Right, how should margins be
set up, then?
INTERNET The left margin should be 1.5
inches, all others should be about an inch. Scrivener's standard script elements start half an inch from the left margin in the editor, so if you print or export with one inch margins all around, everything should be dandy.
KB What about fonts?
INTERNET As usual with manuscript
1
KB thinks
Suddenly,
formatting, the standard is a Courier 12-point font.
for a moment before continuing.
KB What about bold and italics? Can I
use them?
INTERNET Hell no. No bold, no italics;
nothing fancy.
KB Can we go to another scene now?
KB gets sucked into the computer.
INT. INSIDE THE COMPUTER - DAY KB looks around.
KB (looking around)
What the--
INTERNET (V.O.) That was a scene heading. All caps.
And this is a voice-over, for no particular reason.
KB Okay, so this is your basic script
format, then. Okay. So how do I get my script out into Final Draft?
INTERNET (V.O.) Just select Final Draft (FDX)
format from the Compile sheet (File &gt; Compile...). If you have a title page, be sure to tick "First document is title page" in the "Script Settings" pane of Compile. The great thing about exporting to the FDX format is that all of the scene synopses, titles and script notes will get taken across to Final Draft too.
KB And what if I want to get my Final
Draft script back into Scrivener?
2
INTERNET You could just drag your FDX file
into Scrivener's binder or use File &gt; Import &gt; Files..., but probably the best way is to use File &gt; Import &gt; Import and Split... This will break up your Final Draft script into separate scenes in the binder, and will import Final Draft scene summaries into the document synopses in Scrivener.
KB Cool. Can I go home now? It's
teatime.

He spots Hope in a coffeeshop and open a conversation…צריך להכניס פגישה עם הדמות של הופ המבוגרת. הוא נתקל בה יושבת בבית הקפה והם מדברים דוגרי. הוא שואל אותה, איך את נשארת פה? היא עונה לו. את בעלי פגשתי פה. המשפחה שלו מקומיים. אלו החיים שלהם שחשוב להם לשמר. אז עשינו כבר לימודים בניו יורק, וטיול לאירופה, וכסף בהייטק. אבל שנכנסתי להריון הבנתי שחשוב להם ולו לגדל את הילדים במקום ששאר המשפחה שם. ופטריק יענה, שהיא לא הבינה, איך את יכולה לחזור למקום שאת צריכה לראות כל יום אנשים שצחקו ובזו לך בילדות ובנעורים? והיא תענה, אני מתענגת על כל רגע שהם נותנים לי שירות...ומה עם הילדים? אני מחנכת אותם להחזיר מכות אם צריך. לא ליזום מכות, לא להתגרות. אבל ברגע שמתגרים בך, אין להם אלוהים. היא מייצגת מקרה שהקורבן מפצה את עצמו בהיזכור יום יומי שלמרות הכל, היא הרחיקה להתקדם מהמקרבנים סביבה. וזה לגיטימי משום שזה לא אלים. הם זוכים ממנה ליחס שווה, בלי להזכיר להם את העבר. הם זוכרים בין כה וכה. 
ככה בעצם הופ שולחת את פטריק לקבל שירות ממרכוס (״הוא אדם מוכשר. והיום מאוד לא נעים לו לידי״).

Patrick get into “Best Buy” and during that time Patrick calls his DRAG HOMIES to ask what's going on.  Eric, now senior service giver, spots him. Embarrassment in the air.

Hi Hope, do you remember me?

Of course. Patrick, Patrick Hill. How are you Patrick?
Hope puts her book aside
PATRICK
Good good...I never thought I will bump in to here
HOPE
(Giggles) I'm always here at my weekly time off. Please, join me
Hope hand-suggesting an empty chair
PATRICK
No, I meant here as here in Smallvile.
HOPE
How come?
PATRICK
Well, I don't like to be a pooper to our small party, but I would assume you will agree with me that for both of us school wasn't easy.
HOPE
I understand what your'e talking about. I remember the roomers you add to deal with, the kind of background. 
PATRICK
You know that I came out of the closet when I left Smallvile. The roomers were true. I don't see myself, ever, coming back to live here.
HOPE

Well, my parents live here. When I had my first child it was obvious that Thomas and I would leave the city and move back. There was no doubt.
PATRICK
I'm sorry but I just don't get it. How can you go back here after the things you had to dealt with.
HOPE
Patrick, I'm a family doctor, I'm a respectable person in the community.
PATRICK
I still don't get how can you see every day bump into the same people that harmed and hurt you so much.
HOPE
Well, I see them when they come to clean up my backyard, and when they puts groceries in my bag. I see them, and to be honest, I don't feel bad about it.
PATRICK
And how do "they" feel?
HOPE
They mostly embarrassed. When they bring their child to my clinic, or when they give me survice. Girl 1 is a medical secretary at the E.R.. Sometimes we have the same shift. Marcus is managing a store. Girl 3 works at this coffee shop. And they are all talented in what they do.
